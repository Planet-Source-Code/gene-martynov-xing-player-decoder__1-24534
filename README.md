## XING Player/Decoder


</div>

### Description

Would not it be nice to have something that can play and/or decode file by using one control? So here we go. Xaudio.dll can do that.

I did not write the DLL itself. Thanks to the guys who wrote it. I just made this DLL work within Visual Basic.

So you will need the xaudio.dll and xanalyze.dll for this project. Place these DLL's into your Windows/System directory.

Read ReadMe.txt file. You can find descriptions for DLL's iin official Xing site or drop me an e-mail.
 
### More Info
